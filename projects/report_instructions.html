                  At the midterm point in a research project, the best practice is to write a progress report so that you can communicate the project's current status, challenges, achievements, and future plans clearly. This document provides general instructions for this report.
                  
                  For summer 2024 students: Each student should write a project progress report and send it to me for review before Jul 8, 2024.
                  
                  Expected report length: 1-2 pages 
                  
                <h4>Report structure:</h4>

                  <b>Project title:</b> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Write a clear and concise title of your project.</li>
                    <li>Name: Write your name below the title and your affiliation (that is, your university name)</li>
                    <li>Date: Today's date</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Overview:</b> A brief introduction to the project research area. Contextualize the problem and why it is important. State your projects goals in this area. This should be concise and no more than one paragraph. An illustration that describes the project visually is preferred.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <b>Specific Objective:</b> Clearly state the objectives of the project in bullet points (these are specific achievable goals). 
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Background / Related Work:</b> In one paragraph, describe the current literature based on your reading of what has been done and what is missing. Include citations [1] in this format where the number “1” refers to a citation that is given at the bottom of the report. Notice how the research papers that you are reading are citing other work.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Methods:</b> Describe the methods and approaches used in the project so far. Feel free to talk about any approaches that did not work too.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Results:</b> Describe your main findings and add at least one graph/figure/output of your project.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Next steps:</b> Discuss current efforts and how they relate to the overall timeline and project goals.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>Main Challenges:</b> Identify main challenges in completing your project.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p><b>References:</b> List all sources cited in the progress report using a consistent citation style.</p>

                  <h4>General recommendations:</h4>
                  <p>Avoid overly complex language and keep the report focused and to the point. For example, if you use ChatGPT or other AI tools to generate the text, then it will turn out to be very bland and clear that an AI wrote it, not a human. Instead, you can just keep your own conversational style language. If you ask clarifications or a revision from ChatGPT for a paragraph, it usually just writes the whole thing and makes it worse. My recommendation is to use it more efficiently by only asking for improvements of particular phrases that you are not happy with. You can also ask AI to give you feedback on what went wrong in a paragraph, rather than asking it to write/revise it.</p>
                    
                  <p>This report is the basis for your research in the next few weeks and a helpful starting point for your final report. I will review your report and send back comments so you can improve your writing and presentation skills.</p>
