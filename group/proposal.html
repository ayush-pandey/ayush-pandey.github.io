        <h2>Research Proposal Guidelines</h2>
        <p>This page provides general guidelines for students aiming to work on a research project. Writing is a key part of research and a project proposal is your first research output. A general structure for a short proposal is below. You are free to change or add things in this structure but try to make sure that your proposal conveys all the points listed below.</p>

        <h3>Proposal Structure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> A short title of your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> A high-level description of what you want to accomplish, in terms that any upper division undergraduate student in engineering can understand. State the problem and the main result you aim to obtain.</li>
            <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> A concrete list of specific achievable items. Objectives support the overall goal but are more specific and testable. Write these such that any expert in the area can understand and accept as valid objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> List any anticipated technical or conceptual challenges in achieving the objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Describe your plan of action. What steps will you take? What models will you use (GPT, Llama, CNNs, ODEs, PDEs, NNs, etc.)? Will you use an existing dataset or create your own? What performance metrics will you use? Provide citations and links to existing tools or models if relevant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by exploring related ideas and reading papers: read the introduction and conclusion sections carefully, and skim methods in your first read of a paper.</li>
            <li>Write a rough draft and refine it as you read more.</li>
            <li>Proposal writing is iterative: get feedback early and often.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Generative AI tools are great for brainstorming ideas but when writing try to present your own writing, even if it's a bit crude.The quality of text generation by AI tools is largely dependent on the prompts and the raw input provided. So, if you use generative AI for writing, make sure that it doesn't just give you generic text.</li>
            <li>Failing to cite related work: State clearly which papers report similar results. This helps you position what is new in your idea.</li>
            <li>Lack of specificity in your approach: What model or method are you using? Is it from literature or your own? Add GitHub links where applicable.</li>
            <li>Not describing datasets or metrics: Be clear on how you will evaluate your work.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Two example proposals from previous students that did a good job can be found <a href="/group/prerana_research_proposal.pdf">here</a> and <a href="/group/saaketh_research_proposal.pdf">here</a>.</p>
