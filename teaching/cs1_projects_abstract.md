We introduce an open-ended project-based assignment for in-troductory AI and programming courses. It positions LLMs as collaborative programmers, but ensures student agency by requiring feasible, tangible hardware outputs. The goal is to promote student learning by asking students to collabo-rate with AI to complete joint software-hardware tasks that AI agents cannot complete but provide assistive support. Specifically, the assignment asks students to pick a person-al project and build it with an AI partner. The key step is validating the final code with a real hardware setup. This moves beyond pure simulation. It compels students to ground their code, and their understanding, in real-world in-teractions. Throughout the project, students learn practical skills like prompt engineering, iterative development, and AI-assisted debugging. They keep a reflection journal and submit their AI chats, showing their thought process. Using low-cost hardware ensures students are active participants. They must understand, adapt, and verify the AI's output, not just copy it. This fosters a deeper, more authentic learn-ing experience and shows students how to leverage AI tools effectively. The assignment is highly adaptable, with many personalized project options to promote engagement, agen-cy, and creativity. The list of open-ended projects, instruc-tional material, and steps for integrating hardware compo-nents into each project will be available as an open-access resource.
