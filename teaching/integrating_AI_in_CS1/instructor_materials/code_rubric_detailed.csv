Criteria,Description,Full Points (15 pts),Partial Points (10 pts),Partial Points (5 pts),No Points (0 pts)
"Branching Statements and Loops","Branching if/if-else and loops for repetitive execution of tasks are two of the most control elements of any Python code. So all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.","Full points: 15 pts","Partial points: 10 pts - If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)","N/A","No points: 0 pts - If the criteria is not satisfied"
"Functions or External Modules","External modules advance the project's features (examples include: random, math, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, tkinter, etc.). Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.","Full points: 10 pts - If the code contains at least one function/external package and makes sense for the project.","Partial points: 5 pts - If the code contains improper use of functions or external packages.","N/A","No points: 0 pts"
"Data Structures","Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.","Full points: 5 pts","N/A","N/A","No points: 0 pts - If no appropriate data structures are used"
"File Reading/Writing or Advanced Engineering Features","If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by any engineering aspects, circuits, real-world data.","Full points: 10 pts - If file reading or engineering features are used (described appropriately in the code)","Partial points: 5 pts - Attempted to use files or engineering features but improper use/didn't not succeed fully.","N/A","No points: 0 pts"
"Code Documentation","Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.","Full points: 5 pts - If at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code","N/A","N/A","No points: 0 pts - If no comments or docstrings are provided."
"Code Runs","Full points if the code runs (given the expected input files) and generates the expected output or files as described.","Full points: 15 pts","Logical errors/corner cases: 12 pts - Half of the files run","Partial points 3: 8 pts; Partial points: 5 pts","No submission: 0 pts - Code submitted, but there are errors."
"Feature Demonstration","Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document?","Full points: 25 pts - If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalents (or new features) were implemented.","Almost all features: 20 pts - Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.","Half partial points: 15 pts - Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented.","Partial points: 10 pts; No Marks: 0 pts - Only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work."
"User-Friendly Interface","Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.","Full points: 5 pts","Partial points: 3 pts - If some user-messages are unhelpful","N/A","No points: 0 pts"
"Project Report","All elements of the report must be complete.","Full marks: 10 pts - All elements are well-written.","Partial 1: 8 pts - One part is missing / incomplete / not well written","Partial 2: 6 pts - 2-3 items in the report are missing / incomplete; Partial 3: 4 pts - Almost half of the report is missing / incomplete.","Partial 4: 2 pts - Almost half of the report is incomplete format; No Marks: 0 pts - No submission"
