"Code runs without errors","","Python code runs without errors.","","",25
"Able to explain all features","Does student show full understanding of Python project objectives? Full points if the student can talk about all of the features of their project.","Full understanding of the Python project features.","","",25
"Able to explain parts of code","Find out 1-2 particular elements in the student's code and ask them to explain what it does. If the student is able to explain the details, then they get full points.","Full points if student explains the code by answering 1-2 directed questions.","If student is able to answer 1 question or part of a question but not everything.","",25
"Significant independent effort? Yes or No","Browse through the .py file(s) of the project. Judge whether the student made a significant independent effort on the project. This is subjective, but try to assess the following (at least one or more of the following criteria is good enough to get full points): 1. Does the project code contain elements beyond the weekly labs, reading, and in-class activities? 2. Does the project code contain external modules that have been applied *extensively* (and the student understands the use of these modules)? Simply using numpy/matplotlib for a couple of lines is not enough. But, using it in a way that is enough to create 2-3 functions/tasks out of the modules is good. 3. Does the code contain meaningful and extensive data analysis of any kind? 4. Does the project solve (as a proof of concept) a real-world application task? Note that code length is not the major factor here because a student can write bad code that takes a high number of lines.","Full points if code has significant independent effort.","","",25
