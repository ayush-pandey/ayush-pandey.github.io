We introduce an open-ended project-based assignment for introductory AI and programming courses. It positions LLMs as collaborative programmers, but ensures student agency by requiring feasible, tangible hardware outputs. The goal is to promote student learning by asking students to collaborate with AI to complete joint software-hardware tasks that AI agents cannot complete solely but provide assistive support. Specifically, students pick a personal project and build it with an AI partner. The key step is validating the final code with a real hardware setup. This moves beyond pure simulation. It compels students to ground their code, and their understanding, in real-world interactions. Throughout the project, students learn practical skills like prompt engineering, iterative development, and AI-assisted debugging. They keep a reflection journal and submit their AI chats, showing their thought process. Using low-cost hardware ensures students are active participants. They must understand, adapt, and verify the AI's output, not just copy it. This fosters a deeper, more authentic learning experience and shows students how to leverage AI tools effectively. The assignment is highly adaptable, with many personalized project options to promote engagement, agency, and creativity. The list of open-ended projects, instructional material, and steps for integrating hardware components into each project will be available as an open-access resource.
