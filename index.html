                <p><img class="profile-picture" src="/Ayush1.jpg" /></p>
                
            <p>I am a tenure-track faculty member in the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced. Before joining UC Merced, I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Ayush_Pandey">Control and Dynamical Systems at Caltech</a> working with Richard M Murray. I am interested in research on control theory and formal system modeling and design with the following goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Can we embed provable guarantees into data-driven methods? For example, is it possible for transformer neural networks to have Lyapunov-like safety and robustness guarantees in controlling physical systems?</li>
                    <li>Can we formally quantify safety and robustness in scenarios where we know that models might fail? Application examples include control of biomolecular networks and autonmous vehicles. </li>
                </ul>
            Specific research keywords under these questions are: 
            <br> <br>
            <b>Control theory:</b> <code>feedback control</code>, <code>robustness</code>, <code>safety representations</code>
            <br> <br> 
            <b>AI:</b> <code>transformers</code>, <code>hallucinations</code>, <code>verifiable safety metrics</code>, <code>mechanistic interpretability</code>
            <br> <br>
            <b>Applications:</b> <code>synthetic biology</code>, <code>autonomous vehicles</code>, <code>cell-free systems</code>, <code>biomolecular networks</code>
            <br> <br> <hr> <br>
            A flip side of this research on computational modeling that I am interested in is the development of scalable (and free!) educational technologies that make classroom learning more interactive and engaging. I am interested in answering the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How does first-generation status impact students' creative exploration in their engineering education?</li>
                    <li>What educational technologies are most effective in engaging *every* student in a classroom?</li>
                </ul>
            Here are some keywords that describe my research in this area:
                <br><br>
            <b>Education research:</b> <code>impact of AI</code>, <code>open-ended assessments</code>, <code>directed mentoring</code>
            <br><br><hr>

            <p><b>Short Biography (third person):</b> 

            Ayush Pandey is interested in research on control theory, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence for the formal design of physical systems. Over the past few years, his research has focused on the development of robustness metrics, safety guarantees, and new inference tools for nonlinear dynamical systems in various application areas. He is also actively extending his research on computational modeling to build open-source educational tools that make classroom learning more interactive, engaging, and student-centered. In 2023, Ayush Pandey received his Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems from California Institute of Technology. In 2019, he graduated with a masters in Electrical Engineering at Caltech. Before that, in 2017, he graduated with a bachelors and a masters degree from the Electrical Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technoloy (IIT) Kharagpur, India.
